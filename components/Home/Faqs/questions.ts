    question: "How much does web design and development typically cost?",
    answer:
      "The majority of our projects sit between £30k and £150k, but project costs will depend on the final scope of work and vary from project to project. We generally have a minimum project size of £25k and prefer to agree a fixed cost with agreed milestone payments.",

  {
    question: "How long does a project usually take?",
    answer:
      "A web design and build project can last around 12-14 weeks, whereas brand-into-website-and-marketing can take 6 months or more. There are always ways to consider business objectives (such as phased launches) so even if your timescales don’t work with this, it’s always worth reaching out. Expect clear milestones and a timeline that respects your urgency, without ever skimping on the quality that makes your site distinctly you.",
